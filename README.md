Fingerprint Feature Extraction Pipeline
Overview
This project implements a classic fingerprint recognition pipeline using a series of image processing techniques. The primary goal is to process a raw fingerprint image and extract its unique features (minutiae points, orientation field, etc.), which can later be used for matching and identification.
The process is broken down into modular Python scripts, each responsible for a specific stage of the feature extraction workflow. The main fingerprint_engine.py script orchestrates the entire pipeline, calling each module in the correct sequence.
Current Status
This project is currently implemented up to the Ridge Frequency Estimation stage. The pipeline can successfully load a fingerprint, isolate it from the background, normalize it, and calculate both the ridge orientation and frequency maps.

File Descriptions
fingerprint_engine.py: The central controller of the project. It loads an image and processes it through each step of the pipeline in sequence. It also handles the visualization of intermediate steps.
segmentation.py: Implements a method to separate the fingerprint (foreground) from the noisy background. This is crucial for ensuring that subsequent algorithms only process the relevant parts of the image.
normalization.py: Contains functions to normalize the pixel intensities in the image, which helps to standardize the contrast and brightness levels across different fingerprints.
orientation.py: Calculates the local orientation of the ridges and valleys throughout the fingerprint. The resulting orientation map is a critical input for image enhancement.
frequency.py: Determines the local spatial frequency of the ridges (i.e., how close ridges are to each other). This, along with the orientation map, is essential for tuning enhancement filters.
The Recognition Pipeline (Current Workflow)
The fingerprint_engine.py executes the following steps in order:
Image Loading: A fingerprint image is loaded from the images/ directory in grayscale.
Segmentation: The create_segmented_and_variance_images function is called to create a mask that isolates the fingerprint area.
Normalization: The image's intensity values are normalized to have a standard mean and variance, improving image quality.
Orientation Estimation: The calculate_angles function is used to build an orientation map, which describes the direction of ridge flow at each point.
Ridge Frequency Estimation: The ridge_freq function is called to create a frequency map, which estimates the spacing between ridges across the image.
Each major step includes a visualization window so the user can inspect the output before the pipeline proceeds.
How to Run
Place Images: Add your fingerprint .tif, .png, or .jpg files into the images/ directory.
Install Dependencies: Ensure you have the required Python libraries installed.
code
Bash
pip install opencv-python numpy scikit-image scipy matplotlib
Update Engine: Open fingerprint_engine.py and modify the image_path variable to point to the fingerprint you want to process.
code
Python
# In fingerprint_engine.py
if __name__ == '__main__':
    # Change this to the path of your test image
    image_path = 'images/sample_fingerprint.tif'
    preprocess_and_extract(image_path)
Execute the Script: Run the main engine from your terminal.
code
Bash
python fingerprint_engine.py
The script will pause at each visualization step. You must close the current image window to proceed to the next step.
Future Work (Next Steps)
The pipeline is designed to be extended with the following modules:
Image Enhancement (gabor_filter.py): Use the orientation and frequency maps to enhance the ridge structure with a Gabor filter. This will connect broken ridges and remove noise.
Binarization (color_threshold.py): Convert the enhanced grayscale image into a pure black-and-white (binary) image.
Skeletonization (skeletonize.py): Thin the binary ridges down to a single-pixel width to prepare for minutiae detection.
Feature Extraction (crossing_number.py, poincare.py): Identify and extract key features, such as:
Minutiae Points: Ridge endings and bifurcations.
Singular Points: Cores and deltas.
Template Matching: Develop an algorithm to compare the extracted feature templates to find a match score.
